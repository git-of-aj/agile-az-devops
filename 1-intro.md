# Agile & Scrum
### AGILE
> One thing that separates Agile from other approaches to software development is the focus on the people doing the work and how they work together.

> Learn the unique terminology used in Agile development from the experts
1. Acceptance Test: An acceptance test is a formal description of the behavior of a software product, generally expressed as an example or a usage scenario.
2. Burndown Chart: 
Burndown charts and burnup charts track the amount of output (in terms of hours, story points, or backlog items) a team has completed across an iteration or a project.
3. Continuous Deployment
Continuous deployment aims to reduce the time elapsed between writing a line of code and making that code available to users in production. To achieve continuous deployment, the team relies on infrastructure that automates and instruments the various steps leading up to deployment, so that after each integration successfully meeting these release criteria, the live application is updated with new code.

4. Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is the practice of merging code changes into a shared repository several times a day in order to release a product version at any moment. This requires an integration procedure which is reproducible and automated.

5. Epic
An epic is a large user story that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories.
